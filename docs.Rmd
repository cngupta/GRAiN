				Click on the 'Gene list upload' box and paste query genes in the text box
				and hit submit. Input list should be prepared according to MSU annotations 
				(LOC_OsXXgXXXXX). If the correct pattern is not found in the list, 
				the input will be rejected. Each gene ID in the input can be separated 
				by a commas(,) or semi-colons(;) or new lines. Best was is to copy and paste columns 
				from excel sheets. For best results, start with fewer genes (10-100), as 
				GRAiN will expand the list if no enrichment is found in the first go. 
				If still no enrichment is found in the expanded gene set, try adding more
				genes in the input.
				<br><br>
				<b>Sidenote</b>: If you have a large number of genes to query, try using a small input size first,
				and check if the genes within enriched clusters are part of the original input set 
				not used in the query. Remember to <b>referesh</b> the app before placing a new query.

						If the input is entered correctly, hitting submit button should display a network window. 
						Depending upon your internet speed, the backend calculations should take between
						7-12 seconds per query.  
						Different node groups 
						are colored differently in the resulting network. The red circles are the <b><i>query clusters</i></b>, 
						clusters most significantly enriched in the input genes. Cluster nodes 
						(red), Gene Ontology process terms (light blue) and Mapman pathways (dark blue) 
						are connected to each other if the overlap between two sets was statistically 
						significant based on hypergeometric tests <i>(qvalues < 0.05)</i>. 
						Transcription Factors (grey) are connected to clusters (red) based on the 
						Jaccard's Index of overlap between predicted targets of TFs and cluster genes.
						TFs are connected to each other if the <i>mutual information scores</i> between their
						network connectivity profiles were high. The network can be interacted with 
						zoom buttons to display node names and view denser parts of the network using buttons 
						below or scrolling.

						Hitting submit button should also display a table window. This table
						displays all clusters that were found enriched in the input geneset
						or their first order neighbors if no statistical significance was
						found in the user input genes. The <b>Size</b> column shows total
						number of genes in the cluster. The <b>Overlap</b> shows overlap between
						inout genes and the cluster. The <b>adjusted pvalue</b> is the multiple
						hypothesis corrected pvalue from hypergeometric test. The <b>GO process</b>
						and <b>Mapman pathway</b> columns show over-represented biological 
						processes and pathways in the cluster. The <b>CRE</b> column shows
						<i>cis</i>-Regulatory Elements found in the cluster by <i>de novo</i>
						analysis of DNA sequence motifs in 1000 bp promoters of cluster genes.
						The <b>Top Regulators</b> column shows top 10 TFs predicted as regulators
						of genes within the cluster.
